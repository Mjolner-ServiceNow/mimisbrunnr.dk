title: "Fundamental changes is introduced in ServiceNow Tokyo"
---

ECMAScript2021 (ES6+) is coming to the ServiceNow Tokyo release. 

For us this is a huge change as it will give us new possibilities for what we can build on the ServiceNow platform as well as how easy and secure we can do it.

We wont be adapting this immediately as it wont be backwards compatible with previous releases of ServiceNow. Thus it wont be until the release of Vancover, which is scheduled for Q4 2023, that we will start to release updates that utilize ECMAScript2021.

There are a lot of great things to come.
