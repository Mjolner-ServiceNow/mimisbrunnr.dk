title: "How to support copy / paste of pictures on Service Portal"
---

The support for users to easily copy / paste images, often times screenshots, to Service Portal is a requirement often seen. Here is how I have accomplished this.

You need to apply this change to any widget that you want to support copy/paste. In this example we will use the "Ticket Conversations" widget, but the same logic can be applied to "SC Catalog Item" or "Ticket Attachments" widget.

Open your instance and go to /sp_config. The click the Widget Editor and open "Ticket Conversations".

We cannot edit this widget as it is read only. Thus you need to create a copy of it by clicking the burger icon to the right and select "Clone "Ticket Conversations""

Giv your new copy a meaningfull name.

Place a checkmark in "HTML Template" and "Client Script". These are the only places we will make changes.

On line 6 add the attribute   ng-paste="paste($event)" inside the <div> tag on the HTML part to the left.

In the "Client Script" window to your right add the $scope.paste function. It is not so important where you add it, just make sure not to place at the same level as the other functions. I added mine on line 56. Here is the code for copy/paste:

```javascript
$scope.paste = function (event) {
  var files = [];
  var clipData = event.originalEvent.clipboardData;
  angular.forEach(clipData.items, function (item, key) {
      if (clipData.items[key].type.match(/image.*/)) { // if it is a image
          files.push(clipData.items[key].getAsFile());
          $scope.attachmentHandler.onFileSelect(files);
      }
  });
}
```

Click the Save icon in the upper right corner and close the widget editor.

Go back to /sp_config and open the Designer

Open the "Ticket Form" page,

Hover the "Ticket Conversations" instance in the main window and click the little trash icon. This will not delete the widget, but only remove the instance of the widget. Next drag your newly created Widget to the place where the "Ticket Conversations" was.

That is it. You can now copy paste/images into the Ticket Conversation. Only requirement is that the user clicks the conversation before pasting.

You may also want to add the following business rule on the sys_attachment table to avoid the creation of files with the name "blob" without any extensions.
