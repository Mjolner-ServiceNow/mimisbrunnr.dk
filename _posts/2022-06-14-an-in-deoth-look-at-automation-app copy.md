title: "An in-depth look at the Automation App"
---

Maybe you saw the video on this years ServiceNow Knowledge conference, maybe you didnt?

We had a great time making this video at an old malt factory in Ebeltoft, Denmark.

In the video we explain what the [Automation App](/automation-app) is and how it can help you automate. We hear from one of our customers and invite two of our in-house experts.

I hope that you enjoy the video. Feedback is as always welcomed.
