## Testing tips  
  
Testing the Integration App can follow different approaches  
  
- **Using Postman**  
  - Use an authentication method and the endpoint from [Step 2](/integration-app/setup/#step-2-configure-message-types) of the Guided Setup 
- **Using a different ServiceNow Instance to act as Service Provider/Integration Partner**  
  - Use the same environment to act as Service Provider/Integration Partner  
  - Set the endpoints to its own instance and the App should act both as Inbound and as Outbound  
  
> _It is possible to contact the Support and be provided with a Test Suite for the Integration App._
