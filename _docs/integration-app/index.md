The Integration App enables seamless ticket and configuration data exchange between your ServiceNow instance and your Service Providers - whether they use ServiceNow or another platform. It supports the synchronization of Incidents, Changes, and Configuration Items, making it ideal for managed service environments, multi-vendor setups, or enterprises with multiple ServiceNow instances.

The app includes a robust, built-in queue for handling all inbound and outbound messages. Messages can be processed synchronously or asynchronously, based on your integration needs. It supports REST and SOAP for outbound communication and even allows Service Providers to pull updates using REST if direct connectivity is not possible.

With its intuitive field mapping capability, you can easily configure how data is sent and received. Outbound triggers automatically detect and send updates, keeping systems in sync without manual intervention. Best of all, the app does not rely on IntegrationHub and requires no additional licenses or transaction fees, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution.
