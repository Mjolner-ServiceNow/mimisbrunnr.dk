To configure messages that should be sent to a Service Provider, you must define the relevant **Outbound Message Types**. These define the structure, target, and handling of outbound communications.

## Basic Configuration

- **Name**  
  Provide a clear and meaningful name for the message type.  
  > _Note: This name will be shared with the Service Provider, so choose something descriptive and recognizable._

- **Service Provider**  
  Select the Service Providers that should receive (or be allowed to retrieve) this outbound message.

- **Table**  
  Specify the table containing the records that form the basis for the message.

- **Description**  
  (Optional) Add a description to help other users (or your future self) understand the purpose of the message type.

## Outbound Configuration

Within the **Outbound Configuration** tab, define how the message should be sent and processed:

### Outbound Type

Choose one of the following methods for message delivery:

- **Direct REST Call**  
  The Integration App sends a REST message directly to the Service Provider. A REST Message must be selected.

- **Direct SOAP Call**  
  Sends a SOAP message directly to the Service Provider. A SOAP Message must be selected.

- **Generic Pull**  
  The message remains in the queue with status `ready`. The Service Provider is responsible for periodically retrieving (pulling) the message.  
  > Useful for cases where a direct connection is not possible.

### Additional Options

- **Distinct Update**  
  If selected, the Integration App will check whether an **External ID** exists for the record:
  - If an External ID exists, the update message will be sent using the specified update configuration.
  - If not, the message is sent to the default (create) endpoint.  
  > Ideal for scenarios where the same message type is used for both creation and updates, and the Service Provider requires different endpoints.

- **Create Response**  
  If enabled, the response received from the web service (SOAP or REST) will be added to the message queue as an **inbound message** for further processing.  
  > Useful for capturing external references such as ticket numbers or confirmation details.

- **Payload Format**  
  Select whether the payload should be formatted as **JSON** or **XML**.

## REST Configuration

- **REST Message**  
  Select the REST Message used to send data to the Service Provider.

- **REST HTTP Method**  
  Choose the HTTP method (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`) used for sending the message.

- **Update REST HTTP Method**  
  If **Distinct Update** is enabled, this HTTP method will be used for update operations.

- **Use IntApp Payload as Body**  
  If selected, the body of the request will be the payload generated by the Integration App.  
  If unselected, the Integration App will populate the selected REST or SOAP message template instead.

---

## SOAP Configuration

- **SOAP Message**  
  Select the SOAP Message used for the outbound request.

- **SOAP Message Function**  
  Specify the function used for standard message processing.

- **Update SOAP Message Function**  
  If **Distinct Update** is enabled and the record already exists, this function will be used for updating the record at the Service Provider.

- **Append to Endpoint**  
  Add a static suffix to the endpoint URL for either the REST or SOAP call, if required.

---

## Result Configuration

- **Unique ID Path**  
  Define where in the response payload the **unique ID** from the Service Provider can be found:
  - Use **XPath** for XML responses.
  - Use **dot-walking** for JSON responses.  

  The captured ID will be stored in the **External IDs** table and used to identify future updates to external records.

---

## Monitoring

- **Create Incident on Error**  
  Enable this to automatically create a ServiceNow Incident if an error occurs during message processing.

- **Incident Template**  
  Required if the above option is enabled. Specifies which template will be used when creating the Incident.
