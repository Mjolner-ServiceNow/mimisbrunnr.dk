To install the widget on all pages of a portal you must include the widget in either the footer or the header of your Service Portal theme.

For an example of how to do this see the “Automize Feedback - High Contrast” theme with the footer “Automize Feedback Footer” which is included in this package.

The code in the footer looks like this:

Customize your settings by changing the values of the options.
