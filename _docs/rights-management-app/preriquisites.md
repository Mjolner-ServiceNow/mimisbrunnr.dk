To be able to use the Rights Management App and access your Active Directory from ServiceNow you need to have the Automation App installed into your instance. You can do that form the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com) and you can follow the [installation guide for the Automation App](/automation-app/azure-setup/) to set it up on your ServiceNow instance.
