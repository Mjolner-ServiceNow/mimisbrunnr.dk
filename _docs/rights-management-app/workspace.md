Rights Management App comes with a build in Workspace. From the Workspace you can perform any action you want like the creation of a user, or a group, role assignment etc. The Workspace was created to make the use of Rights Management App easier and get a better visualization of your resources. 

## Contents 

Rights Management App Workspace has a home page from where you can see information about your domains like your groups and users.
