Connect to your Active Directory and Azure Active Directory from your ServiceNow instance and manage all resourses directly from ServiceNow. Control who has access to systems, applications and data resources across your enterprise and enable time limited membership.
If your organisation is struggling to follow account permissions given to users and enforce security Rights Management App enables visibility into how users and group memberships are configured, their permissions and roles. With Rights Management App you can limit the access of users and admins with time limited memberships which will reduce risk and highten security.
 

### Key application areas
- Active Directory monitoring.

  With Active Directory Monitoring you get full overview of users, groups and memberships. Rights Management App gives you the advantage to know who has what access whenever you want from ServiceNow. You can monitor users permissions and detect malicious accounts with insecure configurations and activities. Before you had to have technical insight into your Active Directory to get the full overview which is a tedious task and the result is often outdated when the report is printed. Now with Rights Management App you have the ability of real-time monitoring of your Active Directory and Azure Active DIrectory directly in ServiceNow and you can share it by using standard ServiceNow reporting or enforcing compliance on groups of you choosing. 

- Role based access 

  In an Active Directory not all users would require access to all the systems, applications and data resourses in the network. This limitation of access is for security reasons, because critical resources could be misused in case a user has the wrong access. With Rights Management App we introduce the roles abstraction layer which controls access of users and groups and also can be used to collect groups required to carry out a certain role such as "Financial Control", "IT Support" etc. This simplifies management access greatly. 

- Time limited membership

  In addition to that Rights Management App time limited membership feature gives you the ability to limit administrators access so that you as an administrator only have administrative access when this is required. A valid from and a valid to date is available for you to populate. Having permanent administrators equals permanent and unnecessary risk. This reduces risk and hightens transparency and compliance - especially if you require a ticket and/or justification before the access is provided.

- Automate everyday tasks with the use of flow designer

  There is a list of available actions you can use in flow designer with rights management app. This simplifies your work because it doesnâ€™t need any coding, it is a simple drag and drop process with which you can automate anything you want for your Active Directory and azure Active Directory
