At Automize, we are committed to safeguarding your data and ensuring transparent, secure, and compliant data handling practices across all of our applications developed for the ServiceNow platform.

This policy applies to all Automize-developed applications, present and future, and outlines how data is collected, used, stored, transferred, and protected when using our apps.

## 1. Data Collection

Automize applications operate within your ServiceNow environment and may process data that you or your users choose to input or interact with. This may include - but is not limited to - form inputs, user interactions, task data, records, or integrations configured by you.

Each app’s functionality determines the type and scope of data it may access. However, no data is collected or processed outside your ServiceNow instance unless explicitly configured by you.

## 2. Data Usage

Data collected by Automize applications is used strictly for:
- Delivering and supporting app functionality
- Executing automations or workflows
- Reporting and analytics (when enabled by the customer)

We do not use or process app data for marketing, profiling, or any other purpose outside of the app’s intended function.

## 3. Data Storage and Transfer

By default, all app-related data resides within your ServiceNow instance.
- Data is only stored or transferred outside of ServiceNow if explicitly configured by the customer.
- In such cases, the data is only stored or transferred to systems selected and controlled by the customer (e.g., Azure, local infrastructure, third-party endpoints).
- Automize does not collect, store, or transfer customer data outside of ServiceNow.

## 4. Data Sharing

Automize does not share any application data with third parties. Our applications do not transmit data to Automize servers or external services unless the customer has implemented such configurations independently.

All data remains under the sole control and ownership of the customer.

## 5. Data Security

Our applications are built natively on the ServiceNow platform, inheriting all its security, access control, and data protection capabilities.
- No access to external APIs or data endpoints are introduced unless configured by the customer.
- All data processing occurs within the secure boundaries of ServiceNow unless the customer sets up external integrations.
- We recommend customers apply ServiceNow’s built-in encryption, access controls, and audit features to secure their data.

## 6. Customer Responsibility

Customers remain in full control of:
- What data is processed by the app
- Where data is stored or transferred
- How external integrations are configured
- Which users and roles have access to the app and its data

Automize provides tools and configuration options but does not access or control any customer data.

## 7. Regulatory Compliance

Automize applications are designed to support compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) through:
- Data residency within ServiceNow
- No external data transmission by default
- Auditability and role-based access control
- Customer-managed data retention policies
